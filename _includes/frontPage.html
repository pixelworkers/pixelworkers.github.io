      <h3>
        The Pixel Workers meet-up is a once a month event where the Central Alberta creative industry can get together, share ideas, have a beer, and unite ourselves so we can all become better, together.
      </h3>

      <p>This is a group for designers, developers, writers, photographers, marketers, and anyone who works with pixels for a living, to find solace in a community that’s virtually non-existent in Red Deer today.</p>
      <p>The format is simple. We get together one evening a month, hear a 10-15 minute lightening talk form a member of our community, and we spend the rest of the evening networking, hanging out, and using the presentation’s topic as an icebreaker for people to meet each other.</p>
      <p>We really hope you’ll join us.</p>

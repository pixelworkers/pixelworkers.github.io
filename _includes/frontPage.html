      <h3 id="postpone">
        Due to a last minute issue with our venue for tonights event (apparently they are closed?), we made the call to postpone tonight’s Pixel Workers meet-up. We’re really passionate about bringing the creative industry in Central Alberta together, and we won’t let this hold us back!

Keep an eye on our website and Facebook Page for October’s event!
      </h3>
      <h4>
        The Pixel Workers meet-up is a once a month event where the Central Alberta creative industry can get together, share ideas, have a beer, and unite ourselves so we can all become better, together.
      </h4>

      <p>This is a group for designers, developers, writers, photographers, marketers, and anyone who works with pixels for a living, to find solace in a community that’s virtually non-existent in Red Deer today.</p>
      <p>The format is simple. We get together one evening a month, hear a 10-15 minute lightening talk from a member of our community, and we spend the rest of the evening networking, hanging out, and using the presentation’s topic as an icebreaker for people to meet each other.</p>
      <p>We really hope you’ll join us.</p>
